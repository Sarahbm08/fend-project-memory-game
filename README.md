# Memory Game Project

Sarah Morley's implementation of Udacity's Memory Game Project. This game is a typical memory game with "cards" you flip over to find matches.

## Game Features

In addition to the basic game functionality, this game also features:

* running timer
* move counter
* star rating depending on number of moves needed to win

## How to Play

Click on a square to see the revealed picture. Select another square at random to see if it matches the first. If it does the square turns green and you have found a match! If it's incorrect, the two squares turn red and then turn back over to hide both pictures again. For each pair attempted to match, the move counter increments. Once all squares are matched, the game ends and displays how you did. You may play again by clicking on the "play again" button.

## Dependencies

* SweetAlert2 for the modal display (https://sweetalert2.github.io/)
* Font Awesome for the pictures on each card (https://fontawesome.com/)
